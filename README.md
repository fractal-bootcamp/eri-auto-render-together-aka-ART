# UNIFIED ROLE-BASED COLLABORATIVE ART PLATFORM

## CORE CONCEPT: Assigned Role Templates (ART)

A collaborative space where participants assume specialized creator roles to collectively generate config-driven art across multiple integrated domains.

## INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENT:

```
The unified environment combines three previously separate project concepts:
- Parametric Garden (organic/biological elements)
- Resonance Field (audio-visual/harmonic elements)
- Architecture of Light (structural/spatial elements)

These now function as interconnected aspects of a single evolving ecosystem.
```

## ROLE SYSTEM:

```
1. CULTIVATOR (Parametric Garden Focus)
   - Controls growth algorithms and organic patterns
   - Configures evolutionary parameters for living elements
   - Tools: Seed Editor, Growth Pattern Designer, Ecosystem Balancer
   - Parameters managed: fractal growth patterns, biological simulations,
     botanical color schemes

2. HARMONIST (Resonance Field Focus)
   - Shapes the sonic landscape and visual frequencies
   - Creates mathematical relationships between sound and light
   - Tools: Waveform Synthesizer, Harmonic Matrix, Rhythm Constructor
   - Parameters managed: sound generation, frequency relationships,
     audio-reactive visualizations, temporal patterns

3. ARCHITECT (Architecture of Light Focus)
   - Constructs spatial frameworks and geometric foundations
   - Defines physical laws and dimensional relationships
   - Tools: Structure Builder, Ray Definer, Material Properties Lab
   - Parameters managed: spatial geometry, light behavior,
     physical properties, navigational pathways, parallax and depth perception
```

## INTERACTION MECHANICS:

```
1. ROLE ASSIGNMENT 
   - Users select a role upon entering (or are assigned based on balance needs)
   - Role switching allowed after creation milestones or timed intervals
   - Special "Synthesis" events where roles temporarily merge

2. INTERDEPENDENT CREATION
   - Changes by one role affect the parameters available to others
   - Example: Architect creates a structure that Cultivator can grow plants on,
     while Harmonist creates sounds that influence growth patterns

3. CONFIG INHERITANCE
   - All changes persist as layered configuration files
   - New participants can build upon established parameter sets
   - Historical configurations can be forked or merged

4. SPATIAL INTERFACE
   - Cultivators see the world through "organic lens" highlighting growth potential
   - Harmonists perceive visual representations of sound waves and frequencies
   - Architects see structural frameworks and dimensional possibilities
